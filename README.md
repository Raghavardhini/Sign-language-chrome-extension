# Sign-language-chrome-extension

A Chrome extension that enhances accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing users by displaying **Sign Language Captions** on YouTube videos. It supports **ASL (American Sign Language)** hand signs for A-Z and 0-9. The extension includes a toggleable "Sign Caption" button similar to YouTube's "CC" (Closed Captions), providing visual representation of captions using static ASL images. Future updates will include animated avatars and full video summarization in sign language.
